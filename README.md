# Today Tia Learned
## Demo  
Try it [here](https://today-tia-learned.netlify.app/)
## Overview
This fullstack app was built when I first learned to use **Supabase** (open-source backend services, alternative to Firebase). It's a game changer, simplifying backend development, helping building things faster with great developer experience (I can vouch for this as a junior dev).   
This app is a place for me to add short fun facts or things I learn during the day. People can react to each fact with "thumb up", "mind blown" and "disagree".    
## üçî Tech Stack: 
React, Supabase, Postgres
## Future improvements:
- More responsive UI
- People can only react once to each fact
- User can edit and delete facts from UI
